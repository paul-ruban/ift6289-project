## Pre-trained models for local testing

To be able to download the models from Huggingface, must run:

* `sudo apt install git-lfs` - install git for large files
* `git-lfs clone https://huggingface.co/<model_name>` - download model specifying the *<model_name>* (Ex. `https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased`)

These models are **strictrly** for local development and testing, and should not be pushed to GitHub.
