## Experiments to run

- [ ] Fine-tune models by themselves
    - [x] Distilbert SQUAD - Pavlo
    - [x] Distilbert SQUAD 2.0 - Pavlo
    - [ ] Bert-base SQUAD - Johan
    - [ ] Bert-base SQUAD 2.0 - Johan
    - [ ] SpanBERT SQUAD ???
    - [ ] SpanBERT SQUAD 2.0 ???
- [ ] Fine-tune with distillation (3 methods), use best model from above - Pavlo
- [ ] Fine-tune with pruning (2-3 methods), use best model from above - Johan
- [ ] Quantize models using quantization methods - NO training
- Choose best in all sections and combine in the final model
