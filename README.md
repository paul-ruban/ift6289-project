## Experiments to run

- [ ] Fine-tune models by themselves
    - [x] Distilbert SQUAD - Pavlo
    - [x] Distilbert SQUAD 2.0 - Pavlo
    - [ ] Bert-base SQUAD - Johan
    - [ ] Bert-base SQUAD 2.0 - Johan
    - [ ] Compact BERT SQUAD [link](https://huggingface.co/google/bert_uncased_L-4_H-768_A-12) - Pavlo
    - [ ] Compact BERT SQUAD 2.0 [link](https://huggingface.co/google/bert_uncased_L-4_H-768_A-12) - Pavlo
    - [ ] SpanBERT SQUAD 2.0 ???
- [ ] Fine-tune with distillation (3 methods), use best model from above - Pavlo
- [ ] Fine-tune with pruning for DistilBERT and BERT Base(2-3 methods), use best model from above - Johan
- [ ] Quantize models using quantization methods - NO training
- [ ] Choose best in all sections and combine in the final model
